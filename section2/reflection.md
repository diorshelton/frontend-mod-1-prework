## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
  <!-- Although I'm working on programming alone and don't have anyone to ask. I feel that I wait too late to ask questions. I spend a significant amount of time trying to solve the problem on my own. Perhaps due to pride or the desire for the satisfaction of self reliance. After too much time has passed I then google an answer or analogous situation in an attempt to find a solution. -->

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
<!-- It felt a little like swimming on my own for the first time. I wasn't sure that I would be able to run the program in node without the command listed but I was able to do it on alone without having to reference the material from section 1. -->

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
  <!-- Daily life conditonal:
    Wake up
    If time === 7:30AM) {
      wakeUP();
    } else {
      stayInBed();
    }
   -->

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
  <!-- To add multiple conditions to an if statement you "else if". In an if statement the program reads the first condition and evaluates it as true or false. If it evaluates as true then the corresponding code block that follows runs and the program exits the if statement. However, if the condition in the first if statement evaluates as false, the program does not execute the code block and moves to the second condition, marked as "else if" and repeats the same process of evaluation. If the statement is true the code block that follows is executed. If it is false then the next else if statement is evaluated. If there are no more else if statements the final statement "else" is run. This else statement is code that runs should all the previous statements evaluate as false  -->

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
<!-- If you want to check that two conditions are true you can use "&&". If you want to check that at least one of two conditions is true you can use "||" -->

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
